# Git Course

This repository holds all files associated with a Git course, which I occasionally teach.

After completing this course, it is expected that the developer should be at a high level of Git knowledge and should be also able to take on advanced challenges at work. 

For further improving, the Author of this course recommends the following technical literature:
- [The Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Pro Git 2nd Edition](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
